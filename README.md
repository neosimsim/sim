# sim
sim is a programmers text editor, where the programmer is neosimsim.

## Name
The name is a combination of names of text editors I used over the years
and wich features I loved

- vim
- sam

And of course the matches my nick :)

## Warranty
You are welcome to use sim and give feedback but beware that I will still analyse
what fascinates me about acme, sam and vim and might change behaviours of sim as
I get more enlightened.

## Goals
- acme compatible plugin


## Features
- Enter on selection calls plumb on selection
- close and attach UI

	To be save against (UI) crashes each file should be kept "open" even if the UI crashes.
	Similar to close and detach on tmux. If the terminal or ssh connection "crashed" tmux
	still runs an can be reattached.

## File server
- <n>

A UI, no matter GUI or TUI just should just watch and present the content of <n>/body

## Keyboard or mouse
I know there are a lot of discussion which is more productive.
I actually don't care. I just have more fun using the keyboard primary.
I don't want to convince anybody. If you prefer the mouse oder the keyboard
just use acme.
